# ðŸš¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
 
## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** â€“ Statistical plots
- **Plotly** â€“ Interactive visualizations

## Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading & Overview
- Previewed the first few rows.
- Checked data types and null values.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Generated mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- Identified missing values and null data points.

### 3. Visualizations
- **Histograms** for numerical distributions.
- **Boxplots** to detect outliers.
- **Correlation Matrix** for feature relationships.
- **Pairplots** to analyze feature interaction with survival.
- **Countplots** for categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
- **KDE plots** to see Age-wise survival trends.
- **Plotly boxplot** for interactive Fare vs Survival insights.

## Insights Found
- Females had a higher survival rate.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers (ages 0-10) had relatively high survival.
- Fare and class were positively correlated with survival.
